# Service-oriented system with REST. C#
Project for a service-oriented system. We developed 2 service and a adminpage; 

# Content in main

# Bookings - REST
Bookingservice is for volonteers and attendees to 'book/sign up' themself on a specific event. Admin has CRUD abilities.

# Subscription - REST
Users can subscribe to specific locations. There is possiblity to show all subscribed events on a users own profile. Altough not in this project. 

# AdminPage, Frontend ASP.NET MVC
Together with another subproject integrated a REST-API to see events, and be able with our own Booking REST API to 'book' themself on that event. Forms to be able to use CRUD.
